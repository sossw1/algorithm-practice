/*
Given an array of integers between 1 and n, of size n+1, write a function which
finds an integer that appears more than once in the array without modifying the
input array. Optimize the solution for space efficiency.

  Idea 1: To use minimal space, sort the array first, then compare neighboring
  elements until a duplicate is found. O(1) space, O(n log n) time.
    Unfortunately, this would either require an additional array of size n in
    memory, or we would be modifying the input array.
