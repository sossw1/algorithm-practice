/*
Write a class for a temperature tracker with the following methods:
1) insert() records a new temperature
2) getMax() returns the highest temperature recorded
3) getMin() returns the lowest temperature recorded
4) getMean() returns the mean of all recorded temperatures
5) getMode() returns the mode of all recorded temperatures. If there is more than one mode, return all of them.

Be sure to optimize for time and space, favoring speeding up the get methods over the insert method. Temperatures will be reported in Fahrenheit as numbers between 0 and 110.
