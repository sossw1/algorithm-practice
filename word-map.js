Write a function that takes a long string and returns a map, where the keys are
words and the values are the number of times the words occurred.
*/

  /*
  For each word of the input string, accumulate on a key inside the map while
  creating new keys for words that have not yet occurred in the string. Make
  sure to skip over spaces, periods, etc.

  Idea: Use array's built in split method to retrieve array of words and
  punctuation, then toLowerCase, then run through array with typeOf string.
