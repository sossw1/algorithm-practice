/*
Given an undirected graph of friends in a network find a shortest route for a message from a sender to a recipient. Return an array of friends that make up this path.

  Idea 1: Breadth-first search for the recipient, storing paths where the endpoint node has not been previously encountered in order to avoid cycles.
