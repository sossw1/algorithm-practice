/*
You are given an array of words that has been sorted alphabetically and then
'rotated' at a random index where the two pieces of the array are swapped. Write
a function that finds this rotation point.

  Idea 1: Since the array is sorted aside from the rotation, we can loop through
  the array and check if each word is greater than the previous word.
